# Overview
In this exercise, you will practice working with controls in a simple app. 

# Scenario
Imagine you are creating a restaurant app for Little Lemon that allows reservations. At one point during the reservation process, the app must ask users to select a time. In this exercise, you are going to create an application that allows you to select a time and day on the calendar for a reservation.  

# Restaurant date reservation feature
# Instructions
Create a new project in Xcode to complete this exercise.

# Once you have created a new project, follow the steps below to create the DatePicker.

Task 1: Create the form
In this task, you will create a new view called ReservationCalendar for your project.

Step 1: With ContentView selected on Project Navigator, select File > New > File.

Step 2: Choose Select SwiftUI View under User Interface and select Next.

Step 3: Name it ReservationCalendar and click Next. 

Step 4: A new view called ReservationCalendar will be created on a different file and added to the project.

Task 2: Create the DatePicker
In this task, you will add a DatePicker to the ReservationForm, which displays the date and time.

Step 1: Add a form to ReservationForm.

Step 2: Add a horizontal stack inside your form.

Step 3: Add a DatePicker to this horizontal stack.

Task 3: Add a Done button 
In this task, you will add a button to the calendar for the customer to use to complete their reservation.

Step 1: Add a button to the right of the calendar so that the user can indicate they are complete with their reservation. Ensure that it displays an icon and the text Done side by side.
